# ❤️ Heart Disease Risk Prediction

## 🚀 Overview
Developed as part of a Data Science internship at Accent Techno Soft, This project leverages machine learning to predict heart disease risk from medical records. The notebook guides users through data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.

## 📂 Features
- Data exploration, cleaning, and visualization
- Multiple machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, ROC curves, and classification reports
- Visual plots for insight and interpretation

## 🗃️ Dataset
- File: `heart.csv`
- 303 samples with features like age, sex, cholesterol, chest pain, glucose, ECG results, and disease indicator

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone or download the repository and open `heartdisease.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Place `heart.csv` in the working directory.
3. Run all notebook cells to execute data loading, processing, modeling, and evaluation tasks.
4. Examine accuracy scores, ROC curves, and other results for model interpretation.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📈 Results
- Comparison of model performance for heart disease prediction is provided, along with visualizations and reports
